# ListSearch

Suppose a store carries the products with the item numbers:  101,  108,  201,  213,  266,  304,  311,  409,  411,  412. Use a List structure (not array) to write a program to do the following:

1. prompt users to search for an item
2. if found, show "The item is found" 
3. if not found, enter the item number into the list for future inventory, and show "Item not found and back ordered"
4. repeatedly prompt user to search an item number until users enter number 0 to exit the program
