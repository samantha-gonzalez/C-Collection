# ArrayStudentID

Suppose we have five students, and each has student ID, first name, last name, and status, and they are shown below:
1012 Bones Smith freshman
1033 Welma Seger sophomore
1156 Frank Mathers senior
1569 Hanes Solo junior
1970 Jack Bush freshman

Create four different arrays for student ID, first name, last name, and status. Then search by student ID. If found, display the student information; otherwise display "Sorry - student not found". You can use either sequential search or the the IndexOf() method.
