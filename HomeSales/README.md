# HomeSales
Danielle, Edward, and Francis are three salespeople at Holiday Homes. Write a program named HomeSales that prompts the user for a salesperson initial (D, E, or F ). Either uppercase or lowercase initials are valid. If an invalid initial is entered, issue "Invalid initial" and end the program. For any valid initial entered, further prompt a sales amount by the salesperson. Afterward, display the salespersonâ€™s name and the sales amount for the salesperson (only display once. We will see how to repeatedly ask for salesperson's initial later).
