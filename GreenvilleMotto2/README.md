# GreenvilleMotto2
In Chapter 1, you created a program named GreenvilleMotto that displays the motto surrounded by a border composed of asterisks. No loop was used there. 

Now rewrite the program as GreenvilleMotto2 to do the following:
1. prompt the user for input of a motto
2. determine the length of the motto
3. use one or multiple for loops to display the motto surrounded by a border composed of asterisks
