# MealPriceCalculation

Create a program named MealPriceCalculation that prompts users enter a meal price and the tip and then calculate and display the total meal price. The program should have a Main () and then have two overloaded methods of the same name CalPrice() to calculate the total meal price, which will be displayed from the Main(). 

In the Main(), first accept a meal price (double) and a tip amount in dollars (double), and call the method to calculate total meal price. Then accept a meal price (double) and a tip in percentage (int) (e.g., 15 for 15%), and call the overloaded method to calculate the meal price.
