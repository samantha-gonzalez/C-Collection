# PaintingEstimate

Create a program named PaintingEstimate whose Main() method prompts a user for length and width of a room in feet. Create a method that accepts the two values and then computes the cost of painting the four walls and the ceiling of the room, assuming the room is rectangular and has four full walls and a height of 15 feet. The price of the job is $12 per square foot. Return the painting cost to the Main() method, and display it from the Main().
